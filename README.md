## Welcome!
I'm learning React basics and I wanted to put my knowledge into practice by building a small project.<br>

What I aimed to practice in this project: 
<ul>
    <li>-Using props in components,</li>
    <li>-Iterating over an external data and displaying it,</li>
    <li>-Some CSS properties,</li>
    <li>-Mastering components.</li>
</ul>
